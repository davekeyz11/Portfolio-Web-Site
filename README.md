# PORTFOLIO-SITE


This is a project is a portfolio website about me, David David. It is made of HTML and CSS but has lots of CSS. The buttons and the nav bar do not link to anything but the first button "Collaborate" Links you to my GitHub profile incase you want to make changes to the website just like adding extra links. If you need extra information to collaborate on the website the information is linked in the cheat sheet.
